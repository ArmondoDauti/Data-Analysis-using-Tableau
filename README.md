Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

Project Overview

In these projects, I used the "Wealth of Nations" dataset to showcase my data analyst skills, including data cleaning, data transformation, critical thinking, and data visualization. The primary tools used for this project are Microsoft Excel and Tableau.

Project Details

Data Cleaning and Transformation (Excel)
I leveraged Excel to clean and transform the "Wealth of Nations" dataset, which involved tasks such as:

Identifying and handling missing data
Removing duplicates and outliers
Standardizing data formats
Creating new calculated fields for analysis
Excel allowed me to employ a range of functions, formulas, and data manipulation techniques to ensure that the dataset was ready for in-depth analysis.

Data Visualization (Tableau)
For data visualization, I employed Tableau to create interactive and insightful dashboards. This step included:

Crafting meaningful visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps
Designing an interactive dashboard with filters, parameters, and tooltips
Using calculated fields to derive valuable insights
Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface
Skills Highlighted
Data Cleaning: Meticulously cleaning the dataset, handling missing data, and ensuring data quality.
Data Transformation: Applying various transformations to make the data suitable for analysis.
Critical Thinking: Analyzing the dataset critically to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
Data Visualization: Creating interactive and informative visualizations to convey key insights.
Usage
Feel free to explore the Excel file for data cleaning and transformation details. The Tableau workbook contains the interactive dashboard for a visual representation of the dataset.

Future Improvements
These projects provide a foundation for further exploration and analysis of the "Wealth of Nations" dataset. Potential future improvements could include additional data sources, advanced analytics, and machine learning models to gain deeper insights into economic factors.

I hope this README summary effectively highlights your data analyst skills and provides a clear introduction to your projects on GitHub. You can customize it as needed to fit the specific details and objectives of your projects.
